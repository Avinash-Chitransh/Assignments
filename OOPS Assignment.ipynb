        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)+\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around objects and classes. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and abstraction by bundling data and the methods operating on that data. Key concepts include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and behaviors (methods) that its objects (instances) will have. Classes encapsulate data and functions into a single structure, allowing for organized and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It contains data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of methods. Objects interact with each other and can be created multiple times from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features, while encapsulation is wrapping data and methods into a single unit and restricting access using access modifiers. Abstraction focuses on what an object does, encapsulation on how it's done.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods (double underscore methods) in Python, like __init__, __str__, and __len__, are special methods with predefined behavior. They enable operator overloading and object customization and are invoked implicitly by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child/derived) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/base). It promotes code reuse and represents hierarchical relationships. Python supports single, multiple, multilevel, and hybrid inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It enables one interface to be used for different underlying data types, enhancing flexibility and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is achieved using private and protected attributes (via single or double underscores) and by defining getter and setter methods. This helps in controlling access and modification of class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor in Python is defined using the __init__ method. It is automatically called when a new object is created and is used to initialize the object’s attributes with given or default values.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Class methods are defined using @classmethod and take cls as the first parameter, affecting the class itself. Static methods, defined with @staticmethod, do not access instance or class variables and are utility methods within the class context.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overloading in Python isn't natively supported like in some languages. However, it can be simulated using default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs) to allow multiple behaviors in one method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding in OOP allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. This enables runtime polymorphism and allows subclasses to modify or extend base class behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A property decorator in Python (@property) allows you to define a method as a readable attribute. Combined with setters and deleters (@<property>.setter), it enables encapsulation while providing a simple interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism is important because it allows for code generalization and flexibility. Functions or methods can work on objects of different classes if they share a common interface, reducing code duplication and enhancing maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract class in Python (via abc module) contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented in derived classes. It cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a template for other classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of OOP include improved code reusability, scalability, maintainability, and modularity. It models real-world entities effectively, making programs easier to design, debug, and extend. OOP also promotes DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "A class variable is shared across all instances of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each object. Class variables are defined outside methods, and instance variables are typically defined inside the constructor.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. While powerful, it can lead to complexity and ambiguity (like the diamond problem), which Python handles using the C3 linearization (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "The __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python are special dunder methods used to define how an object is represented as a string.\n",
        "__str__ is meant to return a user-friendly string representation of an object. It is used when the print() function is called on an object or when str() is used.\n",
        "__repr__ is more developer-focused. It should return a string that ideally could be used to recreate the object. It is called when using repr() or when an object is inspected in the interactive console.\n",
        "class Book:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, title):\n",
        "        self.title = title\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __str__(self):\n",
        "        return f\"Book title: {self.title}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __repr__(self):\n",
        "        return f\"Book('{self.title}')\"\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent or superclass. It's especially important in class inheritance where a child class wants to extend or modify the behavior of its parent without completely overriding it.\n",
        "By using super(), you ensure proper method resolution order (MRO), especially in multiple inheritance scenarios. It helps maintain clean and maintainable code.\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        super().speak()\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor method in Python. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed—typically when its reference count drops to zero.\n",
        "This method is mainly used to clean up resources like closing files or database connections before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "class FileHandler:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, filename):\n",
        "        self.file = open(filename, 'r')\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __del__(self):\n",
        "        self.file.close()\n",
        "        print(\"File closed.\")\n",
        "However, over-reliance on __del__ is discouraged because:\n",
        "The timing of __del__ execution is not guaranteed (especially with circular references or in interpreters with garbage collection).\n",
        "It can interfere with garbage collection and lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.\n",
        "A better practice is to use context managers (with statement) and the __enter__ and __exit__ methods for deterministic resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods that are not bound to an instance. However, they serve different purposes:\n",
        "A static method does not take self or cls as its first argument. It behaves like a regular function but resides within a class. It's used when the method doesn’t need access to the instance or class itself.\n",
        "class Math:\n",
        "    @staticmethod\n",
        "    def add(a, b):\n",
        "        return a + b\n",
        "A class method takes cls as its first parameter and can access or modify the class state. It is often used as alternative constructors or for class-level operations.\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    count = 0\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        Person.count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def get_count(cls):\n",
        "        return cls.count\n",
        "\n",
        "Use @staticmethod for utility functions, and @classmethod when you need to access or change class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is often used with inheritance to enable different subclasses to define their own unique behaviors while sharing the same interface.\n",
        "\tExample.\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Bark\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Meow\"\n",
        "\n",
        "def animal_sound(animal: Animal):\n",
        "    print(animal.speak())\n",
        "\n",
        "animal_sound(Dog())\n",
        "animal_sound(Cat())\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, even though Dog and Cat are different classes, they both respond to speak() because they inherit from Animal. This is runtime polymorphism.\n",
        "Python also supports duck typing, where polymorphism is achieved based on whether the method or property exists on an object, regardless of its class hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        " 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line. Each method in the chain returns the object itself (self), allowing the next method to be called on it.\n",
        "Method chaining improves code readability and conciseness, especially in builder patterns or fluent interfaces. To support chaining, methods should consistently return self (the instance) at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a regular function. This can be useful for creating function-like objects (also known as functors), decorators, or simplifying APIs.\n",
        "The __call__ method gives object instances the behavior of a function while still maintaining object-oriented structure.\n",
