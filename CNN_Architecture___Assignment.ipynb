        "Network). How do they affect the output dimensions of feature maps?\n",
        "\n",
        "In a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), padding and stride are two key parameters that directly influence the size of the output feature maps. Padding refers to the practice of adding extra rows and columns, usually filled with zeros, around the input image before applying a convolution. Its primary purpose is to control how much of the border information is preserved during convolution and to prevent the feature maps from shrinking too quickly. Without padding (called valid padding), the output becomes smaller than the input after each convolution. With zero padding (often called same padding), enough zeros are added so that the output feature map has the same spatial dimensions as the input when the stride is one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stride, on the other hand, determines how many steps the convolutional filter moves across the input. A stride of one means the filter slides one pixel at a time, creating the maximum number of overlapping regions and thus producing a larger output feature map. Increasing the stride reduces overlap, making the output smaller and effectively downsampling the input. The relationship between input size, filter size, padding, and stride can be expressed mathematically as:\n",

Together, they determine the resolution and scale of the feature maps in a CNN."

        "\n",
        "In the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the receptive field refers to the specific region of the input image that influences a particular neuron or unit in a feature map. In simpler terms, it is the portion of the input data that a neuron “sees” or is sensitive to. For the first convolutional layer, the receptive field is just the size of the filter (for example, a 3×3 kernel). However, as we move deeper into the network, the receptive field of neurons increases because each layer combines information from multiple neurons of the previous layer. Eventually, deeper neurons capture patterns that span larger areas of the original image.\n",
        "\n",
        "The receptive field is important in deep architectures because it determines how much contextual information the network can capture. In shallow layers, a small receptive field allows the model to focus on fine-grained local features such as edges, corners, or textures. As the network grows deeper, the receptive field expands, enabling neurons to integrate these local patterns into more complex structures, such as object parts or even entire objects. If the receptive field is too small, the model may fail to capture global context, which is essential for tasks like image classification, object detection, and scene understanding. Conversely, a sufficiently large receptive field ensures that the CNN can effectively recognize both local details and global patterns, making deep architectures powerful for handling complex visual data."
