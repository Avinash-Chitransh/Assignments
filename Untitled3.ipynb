        "\n",
        "In probability theory, a random variable is a numerical representation of the outcomes of a random process or experiment. It essentially assigns a real number to each possible outcome in a sample space. Random variables help bridge the gap between theoretical probability models and real-world numerical data. They are classified into two main types: discrete and continuous. A discrete random variable takes on a finite or countable number of values, such as the number of heads in five coin tosses. On the other hand, a continuous random variable can assume an infinite number of values within a given range, like the time it takes for a machine to complete a task or the temperature in a room. Random variables are crucial in statistical analysis, as they allow us to apply mathematical techniques to assess probabilities, calculate expected values, and derive probability distributions. They are foundational in fields like economics, engineering, computer science, and many others that rely on data-driven decision-making. By modeling uncertainties numerically, random variables enable researchers to perform rigorous analyses and make predictions based on probabilistic reasoning.\n",

        " 2. What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "Random variables are primarily categorized into two types: discrete and continuous, based on the nature of the values they can take. A discrete random variable is one that can take on a countable number of distinct values. Common examples include the number of cars in a parking lot, the roll of a die, or the number of goals in a football match. These variables are typically associated with count-based outcomes and often analyzed using a probability mass function (PMF).\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a continuous random variable can assume any value within a given range or interval, including fractions and irrational numbers. Examples include measurements such as height, temperature, or time. These variables are analyzed using a probability density function (PDF), since the probability of a continuous variable taking any single exact value is technically zero; instead, we consider the probability over intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both types are critical in probability theory and statistical analysis, offering a foundation for probability distributions, statistical inference, and real-world modeling. The type of random variable determines the appropriate methods for analysis, affecting everything from visualization to hypothesis testing and prediction techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        "\n",
        "The difference between discrete and continuous distributions lies in the nature of the values their respective random variables can assume. A discrete distribution describes the probabilities of outcomes that are countable and distinct. Examples include the binomial distribution, where the number of successes in a series of yes/no experiments is counted, and the Poisson distribution, which counts the number of events occurring within a fixed interval. The key characteristic of a discrete distribution is that it is defined at specific points, and the sum of the probabilities of all possible values equals one.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, a continuous distribution pertains to random variables that can take on any value within a continuous range. This includes measurements like weight, time, or temperature. Continuous distributions are characterized using a probability density function (PDF), and the total area under the curve of the PDF equals one. Probabilities are calculated over intervals, not at individual points. The normal distribution is a common example, featuring a symmetric bell-shaped curve centered at the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the distinction is essential because the analytical techniques, formulas, and tools differ depending on whether the data are discrete or continuous. The nature of the distribution influences hypothesis testing, estimation, and data modeling approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "\n",
        "A Probability Distribution Function (PDF) describes the likelihood of each possible value of a random variable. For discrete variables, it's the probability mass function (PMF), and for continuous variables, it defines a density curve under which total area = 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "\n",
        "PDF gives the probability of a specific value.\n",
        "\n",
        "CDF gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. Mathematically, CDF is the integral (or sum) of the PDF.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "In a discrete uniform distribution, all outcomes are equally likely. Example: Rolling a fair die, where each number (1–6) has a probability of 1/6.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",

        "\n",
        "9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Poisson distribution models the number of occurrences of an event in a fixed interval of time or space with a known constant mean rate. Used in call centers, web traffic, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "A continuous uniform distribution assumes equal probability for all values within a certain range [a, b]. The PDF is constant and equal to 1/(b−a).\n",

        "\n",
        "A standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with μ = 0 and σ = 1. It's critical because many statistical methods use Z-scores derived from it for inference and hypothesis testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "CLT justifies the use of the normal distribution to approximate the behavior of sample means and sums, especially when the sample size is large (n ≥ 30 is a common rule of thumb).\n",

        "15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",

        "19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n",
        "\n",

        "20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
        "\n",
