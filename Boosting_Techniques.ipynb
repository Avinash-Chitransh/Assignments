        "learners.\n",
        "\n",
        "Boosting in Machine Learning is an ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners to form a strong learner with high predictive accuracy. A weak learner is a model that performs only slightly better than random guessing, such as a shallow decision tree (also called a decision stump). Boosting works by training weak learners sequentially, where each new model focuses on the mistakes of its predecessors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common boosting algorithms include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. The core idea is to assign weights to training samples: initially, all samples are equally weighted. After the first weak learner is trained, misclassified samples receive higher weights, making them more influential in the training of the next learner. This process continues for a set number of iterations or until performance stops improving.\n",
        "\n",
        "In AdaBoost, the final prediction is obtained by weighted majority voting (classification) or weighted averaging (regression) of all weak learners. In Gradient Boosting, instead of adjusting weights explicitly, the new learners fit the residual errors (gradients) of the previous model, effectively correcting mistakes in a gradient descent manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Boosting improves weak learners by:\n",
        "\n",
        "Focusing on hard-to-predict cases – making subsequent models learn from mistakes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Combining many low-accuracy models – reducing bias and variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iteratively refining predictions – leading to high accuracy even with simple base models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, boosting transforms weak learners into a strong ensemble model capable of achieving state-of-the-art results in classification and regression tasks. However, it can be sensitive to noise and prone to overfitting if not tuned carefully."
