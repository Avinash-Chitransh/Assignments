        "1. What is Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one independent variable (X). It fits a straight line (Y = mX + c) to the data, where m is the slope and c is the intercept. The objective is to predict the value of Y for a given X based on historical data. It's widely used in predictive modeling when the goal is to understand or forecast the impact of one variable on another. This method assumes a linear relationship, constant variance of errors, and independence of observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The key assumptions are:\n",
        "Linearity: The relationship between X and Y is linear.\n",
        "Independence: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
        "Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of residuals across all levels of X.\n",
        "Normality: Residuals (errors) are normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "No multicollinearity (relevant in multiple regression).\n",
        "These assumptions ensure the validity and reliability of the regression estimates. Violation of these assumptions can lead to biased or inefficient estimations, making the model unsuitable for prediction or interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does the coefficient m represent in the equation Y = mX + c?\n",
        "\n",
        "The coefficient m is the slope of the regression line. It represents the rate of change in the dependent variable Y for every one-unit increase in the independent variable X. For instance, if m = 2, it means Y increases by 2 units for every additional unit of X. The slope quantifies the strength and direction (positive or negative) of the relationship between X and Y. A positive slope indicates a direct relationship, while a negative slope suggests an inverse relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What does the intercept c represent in the equation Y = mX + c?\n",
        "\n",
        "The intercept c is the value of Y when X = 0. It represents the point at which the regression line crosses the Y-axis. This constant helps anchor the regression line on the graph and serves as a baseline value. While it may not always have a meaningful real-world interpretation—especially if X = 0 is outside the range of observed data—it is mathematically essential for defining the linear equation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do we calculate the slope m in Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",

        "This formula minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted Y values. It essentially measures the covariance of X and Y divided by the variance of X. The result tells us how much Y changes, on average, when X changes by one unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the purpose of the least squares method in Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The least squares method aims to find the line that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals (differences between actual and predicted Y values). It ensures the best possible linear fit for the data. This technique provides unbiased estimates of the regression coefficients (slope and intercept) under the assumption that errors are random and normally distributed.\n",

        "7. How is the coefficient of determination (R²) interpreted in Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The coefficient of determination, R², measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1:\n",
        "\n",
        "R² = 1 indicates a perfect fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "R² = 0 means no predictive power.\n",
        "For example, R² = 0.85 means that 85% of the variability in Y is explained by X. A higher R² suggests a better model fit, although it doesn’t guarantee accuracy or causation.\n",

        "9. What is the main difference between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The main difference lies in the number of independent variables used:\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression uses one independent variable.\n",
        "Multiple Linear Regression uses two or more.\n",
        "This expands the ability to model complex relationships. MLR can explain more variability in the dependent variable but also requires careful handling of multicollinearity and interaction effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the key assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The key assumptions include:\n",
        "Linearity: Linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.\n",
        "Independence: Observations are independent.\n",
        "Homoscedasticity: Equal variance of residuals.\n",
        "Normality of residuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "No multicollinearity: Independent variables should not be highly correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "No autocorrelation: Especially in time series data.\n",
        "Meeting these assumptions ensures the statistical validity and reliability of the regression coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is heteroscedasticity, and how does it affect the results of a Multiple Linear Regression model?\n",
        "\n",
        "Heteroscedasticity occurs when the variance of the residuals is not constant across all levels of the independent variables. This violates one of the key assumptions of regression and can result in:\n",
        "\n",
        "Biased standard errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Incorrect hypothesis tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unreliable confidence intervals.\n",
        "Heteroscedasticity doesn’t bias the coefficients but makes them less efficient. Remedies include transforming variables or using robust standard errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How can you improve a Multiple Linear Regression model with high multicollinearity?\n",
        "\n",
        "High multicollinearity occurs when independent variables are highly correlated, leading to unstable coefficient estimates. To reduce it:\n",
        "\n",
        "Remove or combine correlated predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",
        "\n",
        "Apply Ridge or Lasso Regression for regularization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to identify problematic variables.\n",
        "Reducing multicollinearity enhances interpretability and model reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What are some common techniques for transforming categorical variables for use in regression models?\n",
        "\n",
        "Common techniques include:\n",
        "Label Encoding: Assigns numeric values to categories (not suitable for nominal data).\n",
        "One-Hot Encoding: Creates binary columns for each category (preferred for nominal variables).\n",
        "Ordinal Encoding: Assigns order-based numeric values (used for ordinal data).\n",
        "Binary Encoding and Target Encoding: More advanced methods, especially useful with many categories.\n",
        "The choice depends on the type of categorical variable and the model's assumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of interaction terms in Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Interaction terms capture the combined effect of two or more variables on the dependent variable, beyond their individual effects. For example, in a model with variables X1 and X2, the interaction term X1*X2 shows how the effect of X1 changes with X2. Including interaction terms helps uncover complex relationships and improves the model’s explanatory power. However, it also increases model complexity and requires careful interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How can the interpretation of intercept differ between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Simple Linear Regression, the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. It’s straightforward and easy to interpret, provided that X = 0 lies within the observed data range.\n",
        "In Multiple Linear Regression, the intercept is the predicted value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero simultaneously. This is often less interpretable in real-world contexts, especially if zero is not a meaningful or plausible value for all predictors. Thus, the intercept in multiple regression serves more as a mathematical constant than a meaningful insight.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the significance of the slope in regression analysis, and how does it affect predictions?\n",
        "\n",
        "The slope quantifies the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in the independent variable, assuming all other variables are constant (in multiple regression). It indicates the direction (positive/negative) and magnitude of the relationship. A larger absolute slope implies a stronger effect. In predictive modeling, the slope is crucial—it directly influences the predicted values. Misinterpreting the slope can lead to incorrect conclusions about the nature or impact of variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. How does the intercept in a regression model provide context for the relationship between variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "The intercept provides a baseline value for the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. It anchors the regression equation and helps in understanding the starting point of the response variable. While not always meaningful on its own (especially when zero values are unrealistic), it is essential for accurate predictions and for interpreting the influence of other coefficients. The intercept’s context becomes clearer when combined with the full regression equation.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What are the limitations of using R² as a sole measure of model performance?\n",
        "\n",
        "R² only measures the proportion of variance explained by the model. Its limitations include:\n",
        "\n",
        "It always increases with more predictors, even if they’re irrelevant.\n",
        "\n",
        "It doesn’t account for model complexity or overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "It provides no insight into prediction accuracy on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "It doesn’t reflect causality or correct model assumptions.\n",
        "To mitigate this, use Adjusted R², RMSE, MAE, and cross-validation alongside R².\n",
        "\n",
        "19. How would you interpret a large standard error for a regression coefficient?\n",
        "\n",
        "A large standard error indicates high variability in the coefficient estimate, suggesting that the coefficient is not precisely estimated. This could be due to multicollinearity, small sample size, or high data variability. When the standard error is large relative to the coefficient value, the confidence interval widens, and the statistical significance (t-value) of the coefficient drops, often leading to non-significant p-values. It implies the predictor might not reliably contribute to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How can heteroscedasticity be identified in residual plots, and why is it important to address it?\n",
        "\n",
        "Heteroscedasticity is identified when residual plots show a non-constant spread (e.g., funnel or cone shapes) around the regression line. Instead of random scatter, you might see residuals increasing or decreasing with fitted values. It violates regression assumptions and affects:\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard errors\n",
        "\n",
        "Confidence intervals\n",
        "\n",
        "Hypothesis tests\n",
        "Addressing it (via transformation, weighted regression, or robust methods) ensures valid inference and model reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What does it mean if a Multiple Linear Regression model has a high R² but low adjusted R²?\n",
        "\n",
        "A high R² with low adjusted R² suggests that irrelevant variables are included in the model. While R² increases with more predictors, Adjusted R² penalizes complexity and only increases if the new variable improves the model meaningfully. A drop in Adjusted R² indicates overfitting, where the model fits the training data well but may perform poorly on new data. It highlights the need for variable selection or model simplification.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. Why is it important to scale variables in Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Scaling ensures all variables contribute equally to the model, especially when they’re on different scales (e.g., income in lakhs, age in years). Unscaled data can cause:\n",
        "\n",
        "Numerical instability\n",
        "\n",
        "Incorrect interpretation of coefficients\n",

        "Problems in gradient-based optimization algorithms\n",
        "Standardization (z-score) or normalization ensures comparable coefficient magnitudes, improves interpretability, and is essential for models that involve regularization (Ridge, Lasso) or interaction terms.\n",

        "23. What is polynomial regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression where the relationship between the independent and dependent variable is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. It allows fitting of curved data patterns using linear coefficients. The general form is:\n",
